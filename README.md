# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks-ANN

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).


# Overview

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their relationship with a business. Predicting churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers and optimize their operations. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a powerful machine learning technique that can be used for customer churn prediction.This project aims to build and train an ANN model to predict customer churn based on historical data. The model takes into account various features  to make predictions.

# Features
Implementation of an ANN model for customer churn prediction
Preprocessing of input data
Training and evaluation of the model
Inference using the trained model
Example dataset for testing and demonstration

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction-ann.git

Install the required dependencies:

# Usage
Prepare your data:

Ensure that your data is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV or Excel).

Modify the data preprocessing steps in preprocess.py according to your dataset's characteristics.

Train the model


Adjust the neural network architecture and hyperparameters in train.py if needed.

Evaluate the model

Assess the performance of the trained model on a validation or test dataset.

Use the evaluation metrics provided in evaluate.py to measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Make predictions

Apply the trained model to new data for churn prediction.

Modify the inference code in predict.py to suit your specific needs.
